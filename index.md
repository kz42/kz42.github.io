I am a computer vision algorithm engineer work at [Juphoon System Software](https://www.juphoon.com/en/). Previously, I graduated from Conell University with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering. Even before that, I was an undergraduate student at Purdue University.

My research interests focus on image and video understanding, and the intersections of vision and other fields (eg. language and voices).

Besides research, I enjoy photography, cooking, and fitness.

## Selected Projects

1. **Real-time Communication with Virtual Background**<br />[[Web Demo](https://kz42.github.io/projects/virtual_background/){: .small__tt}] [[Report](assets/docs/virtual_background/virtual_background.pdf){: .small__tt}] [[Real-time Virtual Background Video Demo](assets/videos/virtual_bkg.MP4){: .small__tt}] [[Real-time Blur Background Video Demo](assets/videos/blur_bkg.MP4){: .small__tt}]

	I demonstrated a model to replace the background in real-time video communication by tackling the problem of portrait matting on mobile devices. The proposed model solves issues of previous models and achieves real-time inference speed while maintaining high visual performance. The Virtual background feature can attain over 25 FPS on 720P on iPhone11 in real-time video communication.

	I've uploaded two video demos for real-time background editing using the proposed model.

2. **Real-time Face Detection and Facial Landmark**<br />[[Video Demo](assets/videos/face.MP4){: .small__tt}] [[Report](assets/docs/face/face.pdf){: .small__tt}]

	Face detector and facial landmark is fundamental to other advanced tasks,for example, face recognition, liveness detection, and face editing. In this project, I will show how to integrate the two open-source works to build a high-performance facial landmark detector, the improvements, and modifications Ihave made for each work. The integrated model can achieve over 24FPS on iPhone X.
