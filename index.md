I am a computer vision algorithm engineer work at [Juphoon System Software](https://www.juphoon.com/en/).
Previously, I graduated from Conell University with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering. Even before that, I was an undergraduate student at Purdue University.

My research interests focus on image and video understanding, and the intersections of vision and other fields 
(eg. language and voices).

## Selected Projects
1. **Real-time Communication with Virtual Background**

[Web Demo](https://kz.42.github.io/virtual_background/) [Report](docs/virtual_background/virtual_background.pdf)

I demonstrated a model to replace the background in real-time video communication by tackling the problem of portrait matting on mobile devices. The proposed model solves issues of previous models and achieves real-time inference speed while maintaining high visual performance. The proposed feature can attain over 25 FPS on 720P on iPhone11 in real-time video communication.
