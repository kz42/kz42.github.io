I am computer vision algorithm engineer work at [Juphoon System Software](https://www.juphoon.com/en/).
Preiviously, I graduated from Conell Univeristy with the master degree of Electrical Engineering. Even before that I was an undergraduate student at Purdue Univeristy.

My research interests focus on image and video understanding, and the intesections of vision and other fields 
(eg. langurage and voices).

##Selected Projects
1. **Real-time Communication with Virtual Background**
[Web Demo](https://kz.42.github.io/virtual_background/) [Report](docs/virtual_background/virtual_background.pdf)
I demonstrate replace background in real-time video communication by tackling the problem of portrait matting on mobile devices. The proposed model achieves real-time inference speed while maintain high visual performance. The proposed feature is able to attain over 25 FPS on 720P on iPhone11 in real-time video communication.
